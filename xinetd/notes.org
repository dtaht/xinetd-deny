* DONE basic env API

* ENV VARS passed to script
** FAMILY
** SRC
** DST
** SRC_PORT
** DST_PORT
** PROTOCOL
** REASON
** ACTION
** TIMEOUT

* TODO figure out call paths to invoke the deny server on
* figure out how to correctly pass new ENV vars
  shell scripts don't have easy access to sockets and ports
